📘 MODULE 2 – Pivot Tables for KPI Tracking (Google Sheets or Excel)

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Build interactive pivot tables to track sales performance by region, product, and sales rep using real formulas and charts.

---

🧠 SCENARIO:
You’ve been asked to summarize performance for a sales team operating across four regions. You’ve been given raw sales data including transaction dates, sales reps, regions, products, and amounts. Executives want to quickly spot top-performing regions and reps.

---

📂 DATA COLUMNS:
- Date
- Region
- Sales_Rep
- Product
- Units_Sold
- Unit_Price
- Total_Sale

---

✅ WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
- Creating pivot tables in Google Sheets or Excel
- Grouping dates by month
- Calculating totals and averages
- Adding filters and slicers
- Building a dashboard-style chart

---

📄 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

🔹 STEP 1: Load the Data
- Open the provided sales file or copy the data into a new sheet.
- Ensure `Total_Sale` is correct (you can re-calculate with `=Units_Sold * Unit_Price` if needed).

---

🔹 STEP 2: Create a Pivot Table by Region and Month
1. Select all data.
2. Go to **Insert > Pivot Table**.
3. Choose to place it in a new sheet.
4. Configure the pivot table:
   - **Rows** → Add: `Region`
   - **Columns** → Add: `Date`
   - Right-click a date in the pivot and choose “Group” → group by **Months**
   - **Values** → Add: `Total_Sale` → set to **SUM**

This shows monthly total sales per region.

---

🔹 STEP 3: Pivot by Product and Region
1. Create a second pivot table (new sheet).
2. Setup:
   - **Rows** → Product
   - **Columns** → Region
   - **Values** → Total_Sale (SUM)

This shows product popularity across regions.

---

🔹 STEP 4: Sales Rep Performance Table
1. Insert another pivot.
2. Setup:
   - **Rows** → Sales_Rep
   - **Values**:
     - Total_Sale (SUM)
     - Total_Sale again → set to **Average**

Now you can see total sales and average sale size per rep.

---

🔹 STEP 5: Add Filters
- To any pivot, add:
  - **Filter** → Date (so you can choose specific months)
  - Optional: Region or Product filters

---

🔹 STEP 6: Add a Chart
1. Select the Region vs. Total Sales pivot.
2. Go to **Insert > Chart**.
3. Use a **Column Chart** or **Stacked Bar Chart**.
4. Title the chart: `"Total Sales by Region"`

---

💡 TIPS:
- Right-click any value in the pivot table to format as currency
- Use slicers in Google Sheets for interactivity
- Use cell formatting to bold totals and differentiate headers
