📘 MODULE 3 – Conditional Formatting + IF Logic in Google Sheets or Excel

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Use conditional formatting and basic IF/AND/OR logic to build a smart, readable order review sheet. This exercise teaches how to flag issues automatically and format cells to guide human reviewers.

---

🧠 SCENARIO:
Your operations team reviews orders daily to spot risks — like overdue payments, large invoices, and product returns. They want a dashboard-like table where those issues are automatically highlighted and labeled.

---

📂 DATA COLUMNS:
- Customer_ID
- Order_ID
- Category
- Order_Date
- Invoice_Amount
- Payment_Status (Paid, Unpaid, Overdue)
- Delivery_Days
- Returned (Yes/No)

---

✅ WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
- Conditional Formatting Rules
- IF, AND, OR formulas
- Flagging issues using formulas
- Smart labeling for dashboards

---

📄 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

🔹 STEP 1: Import the Data
- Copy or open the provided sales data into a new Google Sheet or Excel workbook.
- Verify all columns are present and `Invoice_Amount` is numerical.

---

🔹 STEP 2: Format Invoice Amounts
- Select the `Invoice_Amount` column.
- Apply currency formatting (Google Sheets: Format > Number > Currency)

---

🔹 STEP 3: Add Issue Flag Columns

1. `Late_Payment_Flag`
```excel
=IF(E2="Overdue", TRUE, FALSE)
```

2. `High_Amount_Flag` (Flag if amount is over $750)
```excel
=IF(D2>750, TRUE, FALSE)
```

3. `Returned_Flag`
```excel
=IF(F2="Yes", TRUE, FALSE)
```

*Adjust column letters as needed based on layout.*

---

🔹 STEP 4: Add Conditional Formatting Rules

1. **Highlight overdue payments**
   - Select the `Payment_Status` column.
   - Format > Conditional Formatting
   - Apply rule: Text is exactly “Overdue” → Fill red

2. **Highlight large invoices**
   - Select `Invoice_Amount`
   - Format > Conditional Formatting
   - Apply rule: Greater than `750` → Fill yellow

3. **Highlight returned orders**
   - Select the `Returned` column
   - Rule: Text is exactly “Yes” → Fill light purple

---

🔹 STEP 5: Add an “Issue Summary” Column

Create a summary column using nested IF/OR logic:
```excel
=IF(OR(A2="Overdue", D2>750, F2="Yes"), "Review", "OK")
```

Or a more detailed message:
```excel
=IF(A2="Overdue", "Late Payment", IF(D2>750, "High Amount", IF(F2="Yes", "Returned", "OK")))
```

Use whichever fits your need — simplicity or detail.

---

🔹 STEP 6: Add Filter View or Slicer (Optional)
- Highlight the entire table
- Use Data > Create a filter
- Filter by “Review” in the Issue Summary column

---
